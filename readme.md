# A bit about me
Hi there, my name is Tayyab Javed, and I'm a Senior Software Developer based in Birmingham, UK. I have extensive experience in developing, deploying, and managing web applications, and I have a diverse technical skill set that includes programming languages such as PHP, GO, HTML, CSS/Tailwind CSS/SQL, JavaScript, and frameworks such as Laravel, React, Flutter, React Native, Typescript Graph QL, Zend Framework, Node.js, Vue JS, Flutter, MongoDB, Firebase, MySQL, Redis, Apache Kafka, Solidity, GIT, Puppeteer.

I am very passionate about staying up to date with the latest technologies, and I am constantly looking for ways to enhance my skills. I have expertise in cloud services such as AWS Cloud Services (Lambda, ECS, S3, DynamoDB, Amplify), GAE (Google App Engine), and DevOps tools such as Docker, Github Actions, Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes.

In my current role as a Senior Software Developer at GRV Media, I have demonstrated expertise in developing and maintaining data-driven platforms, specifically in client analytics. I have utilized Laravel, a PHP framework, for creating front-end and back-end of the platform displaying page views, revenue data, and other key metrics for publisher websites. I have also used Laravel Forge Workers for data collection and scheduling jobs to run hourly to pull the Google Ad Manager and Analytics API for data importation. My proficiency in React for building MVPs and AWS Lambda for scalable backend APIs is noteworthy.

In my previous roles, I have led web scraping projects, developed custom factory management software, managed overseas development teams, and created e-commerce platforms. I have also received several certifications, including AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (2022-2025), and I am pending Kubernetes CKAD (2023) and AWS Developer Associate (2023).

Overall, I am a highly skilled and accomplished software developer with extensive experience in web development, cloud services, and DevOps. My passion for staying up to date with the latest technologies, my ability to manage teams, and my experience in executing projects with exceptional leadership skills make me a valuable asset to any organization.
